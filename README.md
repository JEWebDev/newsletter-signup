## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex box
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned a lot with this project

- Client side form validation with javascript and regular expressions

- How to manage the submit event on forms with javascript

- How to use custom markers for list elements

- How to show a success message on form submit

### Continued development

I want to continue learning to come back to this project and make the validation server side instead of client side. And send the form data to the server.
